<!-- The buyer of the house currently owns a property and lives in it as their main residence.
• The buyer does not conduct any kind of business activity from their house i.e., it is purely for
personal use.
• The buyer does not own any other properties.
• At the end of the purchase the buyer will still only own one house i.e., they intend to sell
their current home at the same date they buy the new one. -->
